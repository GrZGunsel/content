            <h1>Benefits of outsourcing angular developer services</h1>
            <p>
              Angular is one of the most popular typescript-based front-end
              development frameworks in the market. Initially introduced as
              AngularJS in 2009, the framework has managed to gain remarkable
              recognition from developers across the globe.
            </p>

              Some of the following benifits of angular developer services

            <div class="benifit">
              <h4>Cut-Down Development Cost</h4>
              <p>
                For many years, businesses have relied on outsourcing to
                cut-down the development cost and increase their revenue. It’s
                worth noting that there’s a significant diversification in the
                per hour development rates in different countries.

              <h4>High Expertise</h4>
              <p>
                As we mentioned earlier, Angular is one of the most complex
                front-end frameworks. If you want to reap its full benefits, it
                is imperative to have a team of expert Angular developers by
                your side.  Now, offshore agencies have a team of highly skilled
                developers who have experience in designing engaging UI using
                Angular’s libraries. Moreover, these developers are more
                experienced than an in-house team of Angular developers as
                they’ve worked on different types of projects.

                The outsourcing industry is highly competitive as there are
                thousands of companies operating worldwide. The only way for
                these companies to survive the fierce competition and secure
                projects are to have expertise in the latest technologies

              <p>
                Hiring an in-house team is less efficient than an offshore
                development agency, especially if you’re only planning to
                develop a single web application. When you hire an in-house
                team, you would also have to pay for additional office space and
                other technical resources to develop the product from scratch.
