                NET framework is a software developed by Microsoft for Microsoft
                Windows. .NET developers are responsible for creating,
                developing and implementing software applications for an
                organisation’s project and internal requirements. They also look
                after system analysis and develop appropriate system responses
                to troubleshoot and fix issues.

                <p>
                  In terms of qualifications, a higher education degree or
                  certificate in computer science with an emphasis on software
                  development or information technology is desirable. .NET
                  developers benefit from possessing soft skills such as
                  computational thinking and spatial imagination mixed with a
                  commercial and organisational mindset. Outsourcing companies
                  can help you find the right candidate to meet your
                  organisation's tech support requirements by hiring these
                  specialists who understand how to design and manage .NET-based
                  software for projects and business use.

                  .NET is one of those frameworks that is used to construct any
                  sort of application with any type of platform. The framework
                  is simply independent and it tends to support all the
                  platforms.

                <p>
                  By research data, .NET is right now supporting about 44
                  languages. The user has the freedom to select the language
                  that they wish to use for the application. One more advantage
                  is that this framework is easily deployed.

                  React is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and
                  JavaScript concepts with some beneficial additions. Still, as
                  is the case with other tools and frameworks, you have to spend
                  some time to get a proper understanding of React’s library.

                  with a variety of IDE’s, but the user can only utilize it with
                  the help of Microsoft Visual Studio. Although it should be
                  noted that it is not free.
